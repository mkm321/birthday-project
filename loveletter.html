        <b>My Dearest Juanita</b>,
        <br><br>
        First of all, I wish you a very happy birthday 🎂.
        <br><br>
        I don’t know where to begin, but I guess “thank you” feels like the right place.
        Thank you for finding your way into my life and changing it so beautifully 💕.
        <br><br>
        Baobao, you came into my life like a blessing. You are exactly what I was wishing for.
        I prayed to God to give me a girlfriend who would truly understand me, but He went above and beyond — He gave me a wife. Yes, you, my baobao.
        <br><br>
        Baby, I really want to reassure you that no matter what happens, I’ll always stand by your side through good times and bad.
        No matter how tough things get, I know we can face it all if we stick together. I love you so, so, sooo much, baobao. ❤️
        <br><br>
        I know things have been challenging when it comes to our families, but trust me, everything will be okay.
        All I’ve ever wanted is a happy, strong family — me, my wife, our kids, and a pet, with both our parents together under one roof.
        And I believe we’re getting closer to that dream, because I found you.
        <br><br>
        I can’t wait for the day we finally meet. I keep imagining our first moment together — holding your hands, hugging you tightly, and kissing you passionately 💋.
        The road ahead may be long, but I don’t mind, as long as you’re beside me.
        You are my strength, my peace, my support. I’m so grateful for everything you do — for always reassuring me, for handling my clinginess, and for loving me so purely.
        <br><br>
        I love how you always say “good night” no matter how tired you are,
        how you share the tiniest details of your day,
        and how you make me feel loved in every little way.
        These small things have built a world I never want to leave.
        <br><br>
        I hope the love and passion between us keep growing stronger every day.
        I want a calm, steady, and beautiful future with you — a life filled with love, laughter, and peace.
        <br><br>
        Always your dummy bear,
        <br>
