# birthday-project
Ahh you’re right 👍 we did map out a **multi-step birthday journey** earlier in this chat. Here’s the flow we had listed:

1. 🎂 Homepage → Cake with candles → blow them out.
2. 🎉 After all candles are out → confetti + balloons celebration.
3. 🎁 Then → a **big gift box appears** (with “Tap to open”).
4. 🎀 On click → it opens into multiple **cute sticky-note-style buttons** (pastel, rotated a little for cuteness).

   * Examples of buttons we planned:

     * “Play Birthday Song in Chinese” 🎶
     * “Make a Wish” 🌠 (which then emails you her wish + shows her “Your wish will come true ✨”)
     * “Open Love Letter” 💌
     * “View Gallery” 📸
     * “Messages from Me” 📝 (stacked pastel cards flipping in).
     * (Optional) Mini **photo puzzle game** 🧩 if time allows.
5. 🎈 Balloon pop celebration could be triggered again at the end of any of these.

So the **gift box reveal** is indeed the *next big thing* after confetti finishes.

👉 Do you want me to now help you code the **surprise gift box + sticky note buttons**, so we can wire it right after the `launchBalloons()` finishes?

That’s a really beautiful idea 💛 — turning your gallery into a **timeline story** rather than just a photo dump. It makes it feel intentional, like walking through your relationship step by step.

Here are a few ways you can portray it:

---

## 1. 📖 **Scrolling Timeline (Milestones + Photos)**

* A vertical scroll with pastel “milestone cards” (like scrapbook notes).
* Each card has:

  * A **date / phase** (e.g., “The First Hello – June 2023”)
  * A **screenshot/photo**
  * A **small caption** you write (your feelings, a funny moment, etc).
* Add cute transitions (fade-in or slide-up as she scrolls).
