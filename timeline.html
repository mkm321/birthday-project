          <p>Our first hello / how it all began.</p>
          <p> 
            Baobao, I know this screenshot is not our first hello, but I still remember the day when I first
            saw you on Ome.tv and the conversation never felt like it was the first time we are seeing each other.
            The interesting topic we started discuss with each other, the wounds we healed for each other.
            I loved every bit of that.

          <h2>Building Connection 🌱</h2>
          <p>They say love isn’t something that happens overnight — it’s a feeling that quietly grows with time.</p>
          <p>
            Baobao, we may have started off playfully flirting, but when you watch this video, you’ll see how beautifully our relationship has matured.  
            In such a short time, we’ve experienced so many emotions together — laughter, sadness, anger, peace — and through it all, we’ve only grown closer.  
            I truly hope our bond continues to grow stronger with every passing day. 💞
